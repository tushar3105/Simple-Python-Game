################################################################################ DOCUMENTATION FOR THE GAME HAS BEEN DONE IN THIS FILE ############################################################################

The AIM of the game is as follows : 
A player has to cross the river from one side to other. In the process he must try to avoid hitting any obstacles, stationary or moving. If he hits any of the obstacles, the round would immedietly end for him. If he reaches the other side, he needs to move in to the box drawn, and the round ends for him.



The RULES are as follows :

1)	Control keys for player 1 are arrow keys (up, down, right, left)
	Control keys for player 2 are W, A, S, D.	

2)	Each player gets 3 rounds to play. 
	After that the game ends declaring whoever the winner is on basis of number of points scored.

3)	Each player gets 10 bonus points on starting of a new round. However after every 1 second 1 point is deducted for the player playing at the moment until he completes the round or dies.
	Moving from one partition to other (both river and ground) gives 10 points. Even if you die in one of the partitions, you do get the points for reaching that partition.



Music, font and background colours, player and obstacle images etc. have been put in the config.py file and can be changed from there if wanted.

Score for player 1 is displayed at bottom-left of the screen.
Score for player 2 is displayed at top-left of the screen.
